"""Anima register-token adapter ComfyUI custom node.

One node:

* ``AnimaRegisterAdapter`` — loads a register ``adapter.safetensors`` (trained by
  ``train.py --method register``) and patches a stock Anima ``MODEL`` so a normal
  KSampler downstream runs with the register tokens + trained QKV surface live.

Comfy-native (split q/k/v against ``MiniTrainDIT``, no vendored training code).
Do NOT stack with the Block Compile node — the register path runs eager.
