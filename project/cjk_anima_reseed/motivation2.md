# cjk_anima_reseed — motivation 2 (2026-10-02)

Takes over `motivation.md` (the morning draft: "the seed trained in the wrong
bands"). This is the record of 09-30 – 10-02 read for what it says about
re-seeding the JA vocab pack's rows cold. Every number is from a dated report
under `../cjk_anima_scale/` (`reports/`, `findings.md`, `hypothesis.md`,
`proposal_seed_synthesis.md`); nothing here is a new read.

**The seed:** `seed_retrain_0930` (`retrain_kana` 174 kana rows cold +
`retrain_kanji_b1`–`b4` on top, routed). On `sent` (184 renders): official 29,
≤ 1 edit 92, a doubled glyph in 100; the word comes out as a banner at
≈ 78 px (long side 401 px).

**The target** (user, 10-02): manga-size dialogue in speech bubbles —
multi-panel and single-panel manga, illustrations — not the `sent` banner.
The large glyphs in the seed's data were for identity.

## Verdict

1. **The seed's bands were right for its glyph sizes.** Every arm of record
   that produced identity trained its glyphs inside the ceiling window of
   their px; every arm that lost it moved the same px above that window
   (§ 3). The morning draft's § 1 is withdrawn.
2. **A row is one vector at every σ.** The band decides what gradient a row
   sees, not where it acts. An item trained above where its glyphs resolve
   teaches its layout alone, and that layout overrides every caption the row
   appears in (§ 2). Confirmed three times on warm arms and once cold, and
   measured on the gradient itself (`reports/grad_identity_2026_10_02.md`):
   at 0.75–0.93 a 15–28 px item's gradient on a cold row is ≥ 90 % the same
   whichever glyph is drawn. The glyph-dependent share falls with σ, earlier
   the smaller the glyph, and its half point is the EN ceiling's upper edge
   for that px; the identity gradient peaks at σ 0.4 / 0.5 / 0.6 for
   15 / 28 / 44 px, and below the peak it is exposure, not identity, that
   runs out.
3. **Where identity is written depends on rendered size.** Layout and slot
   count at σ ≥ 0.9; identity at 0.85–0.7 for large glyphs, below 0.8 for the
   seed's small JA; nothing moves below 0.5 (§ 1).
4. **Identity does not need large glyphs.** `p1_cold` — 36 hiragana rows cold,
   in-word items at 0.3–0.7 only, nothing above ≈ 40 px — reads ≤ 1 edit
   65 / 128. The large lone tier buys the lone single (official 29 → 82 / 144)
   and a larger rendered glyph (banner 75 → 87 → 131 px across
   `p1_cold` / `p1_mix` / `p1_lone`) (§ 3).
5. **Every warm arm on the seed lost strings** — polish, garble_replace (nine
   variants), span_reband, seed_synth, b0305_reband, Δ scaling — whatever it
   moved in layout (§ 4). The rows already carry what their items taught; a
   warm pass adds to it. None of the data questions has been read cold.
6. **A σ gate does not give manga-size text.** The base above 0.8 with the
   seed rows below keeps the base's small bubbles and writes the word's
   glyphs into them, with repeats: 0–1 / 16 official against the seed's 7
   (§ 1).

So the reseed is: cold rows, small glyphs at the band law's bands for their
px, a bubble-shaped target — and the open reads are whether small-only
training writes manga-size text when the caption gives it a bubble, and
where small-text identity sits in σ (§ 6).

## 1. Where the text is decided on the trajectory

`reports/sigma_split_2026_09_30.md`, `findings.md` (x̂0 per σ, σ-gated rows;
`sent` grid, 512², 28 steps, cfg 4, shift 3: σ 1 → 0.9 is steps 0–7,
0.9 → 0.69 steps 7–16, < 0.5 the last 7).

- **Layout at σ ≥ 0.9, identity 0.85–0.7, nothing below 0.5.** The base
  writing 12–18 px EN in a bubble reads 61 % of words at σ 0.85, 80 % at
  0.75, 83 % at the end; a 3 × 3 EN grid has its rows placed at σ 1.0, slots
  at 0.95, most words by 0.85. The seed's rows commit earlier than EN: the
  JA banner already reads at 0.9. Below 0.5 only stroke detail moves, and
  it follows x_t, not the caption — rows gated to act only below 0.5 read
  0 / 184; the caption itself has no leverage there.
- **The σ that sets a glyph follows its rendered size.** The seed's trained
  singles in a ≈ 100 px grid are set by 0.9 and survive the conditional
  dropped at 0.8 (64 / 72 → 61; what flips is dakuten / handakuten); the
  seed's own b0305 captions (12–24 px dialogue windows) lose every string
  when it is dropped at 0.8 (7 / 16 → 0, CER 0.29 → 0.80). For small text
  the seed's identity is written **below** 0.8.
- **Rows only above 0.8** keep the floor's layout to the third decimal and
  a third of its strings (official 29 → 10–13, the top banners); the rest
  are rewritten by the base in the same slots. Rows only below 0.8, with
  the base's garble layout above, recover 16 / 29 official and 61 / 92
  ≤ 1 edit — into the base's bubbles, split across them. Neither side alone
  reaches the floor.
- **The mirror on small text (10-02):** the base above 0.8 and the seed
  rows below, on the 16 b0305 renders — official 0–1 (CER 0.80 → 0.55–0.62):
  the rows write the word's glyphs into the base's small bubbles, into more
  slots than the word has (`んだだよよウチ`, `なアロロナ`). The seed arm's 7
  draws the same word large; the comparison is two sizes. n = 16, captions
  of 3–5 glyphs, one switch.
- **The repeats are the base's text region minus the word.** The region's
  span is set by σ 0.95 with or without rows (`japanese text` tag → the
  long banner; without it, a 2-glyph line); the slot count commits between
  0.95 and 0.9 (`inject_count`: a hand-made n-slot banner injected at 0.9
  turns 0 / 60 official into 29 / 60, dup 60 → 21). A caption that fills the
  slots reads better (こんにちはは 4 / 8 vs こんにちは 2 / 8; こんにちは！ 5 / 8
  with 7 / 8 free of repeats).

## 2. A row is one vector at every σ (`hypothesis.md` H1)

A row is added at encode (`ExtDelta` on `llm_adapter.embed`); it has no σ
input. The ceiling table (`band_experiment_results.md` § 2) is where a
teacher-forced loss carries a caption gradient for a glyph of that px —
training is teacher-forced, so it is the only thing a band can follow. The
trajectory (§ 1) is where the vector is consumed. Two quantities, not a
contradiction (`reports/band_size_2026_10_02.md`).

What follows, and what read it:

- **An item above where its glyphs resolve teaches layout only, and that
  layout lands in the high-σ steps that set every caption's layout.**
  `b0305_reband` (the seed's 12–24 px windows warm at 0.75–0.93, μ 0.02):
  the floor's banner turns into small columns and sentence-length lines in
  bubbles. `shared_dir` splits its update: the break is in the per-row
  residual, not the mean direction, and it acts above 0.8 — the seed rows
  above 0.8 restore the floor's layout on every placement measure, and the
  arm's rows below 0.8 alone cost strings (≤ 1 edit 45 → 25–32, seed 0).
- **What the band teaches is the item's glyph size relative to its region;
  the region stays the base's.** `span_reband` (≈ 34 px word windows at
  0.85–0.95, warm): the banner stays, the glyphs in it get smaller and
  more — official 29 → 16, dup 100 → 113, banner glyph 78 → 68 px; its
  whole effect is above 0.8. `seed_synth` (the seed's own renders with the
  word redrawn to fill the base's region, 208 canvases × 10 same-length
  swaps, at 0.85–0.95 warm): size did not transfer (px 43 items, banner
  78 → 78) but the count did not either — dup 100 → 116, extra glyphs on
  the long words (`たたすすけけて`). Three item sets at 0.75–0.95 each put
  more glyphs in the base's region: the slot count is not a σ-less row's
  to carry from items trained above 0.85.
- **Cold, the same:** `kana_reband` (the kana run's all-hiragana items,
  every one at 0.75–0.93, 81 rows cold, 135 / row): words 0 / 72 at every
  threshold against `retrain_kana`'s 10 / 33 / 53, singles 0 / 64 vs
  17 / 44; the renders are small columns in bubbles with no identity, and
  the scene style leaks (monochrome sketches). Confounded (the hiragana
  filter dropped 2 272 of 2 314 multi-cell grids; 81 rows vs 174; the lone
  glyphs moved too), but it is what the ceiling table says of 18–34 px
  words above σ 0.6.
- **`garble_replace` short50 at 0.8–0.95** (14 px lines): the rows learn
  the canvases' bubbles (white blobs at σ 1.0 / 0.95) and no string
  (≤ 1 edit 7 / 184; strokes only form at σ ≤ 0.5). At its own band
  (0.6–0.85) the same items keep the banner and read 18.
- **The gradient, no training** (`reports/grad_identity_2026_10_02.md`; the
  grid_44 items, the 81 hiragana rows cold at the pack rows): with the row
  and caption fixed and the glyph drawn in its slot swapped, the share of
  the row's gradient that depends on the glyph is 0.31 / 0.32 / 0.36 at the
  top of the law's band for 15 / 28 / 44 px grid cells, 0.09 / 0.19 / 0.36 at
  σ 0.7, and ≤ 0.16 everywhere in 0.75–0.93 for 15–28 px. Its half point
  (0.62 / 0.72 / 0.76) is the EN ceiling's upper edge (0.6 / 0.7 / 0.8); the
  identity gradient's size peaks at 0.4 / 0.5 / 0.6. Below the peak the
  share holds and the gradient collapses (50× at σ 0.2 for 44 px). A lone
  1×1 under the plain canvas loss gets 3–10× less identity per draw than a
  grid cell of the same px. Step 0 only — necessary, not sufficient.

## 3. The seed's data, measured against the law

`reports/band_size_2026_10_02.md` § 1, § 4–5; `motivation.md` § 1, § 4.
Every run in the chain drew `builder.TABLE`'s three groups 1 : 1 : 1.
Drawn px (√(box area / glyphs)), p5 – p50 – p95, `retrain_kana` / `b4`:

| group, recipe | σ | text | `retrain_kana` | `b4` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `b0709` `grid_single` | 0.7–0.9 | one glyph per cell | 52 – 91 – 232 | 62 – 108 – 271 |
| `b0709` `scene_single` | 0.7–0.9 | one glyph | 41 – 52 – 82 | 42 – 55 – 92 |
| `b0507` `scene_window` | 0.5–0.7 | word | 28 – 34 – 51 | 30 – 35 – 53 |
| `b0507` `scene_single_small` | 0.5–0.7 | one glyph | 26 – 32 – 38 | 31 – 36 – 40 |
| `b0305` `scene_window` | 0.3–0.5 | word | 14 – 18 – 23 | 14 – 18 – 23 |

- Each size has one recipe and one band. A word is never above 64 px and
  never above σ 0.7; a glyph above 64 px is always a lone glyph. The seed's
  banner (≈ 78 px) is a size no word item was drawn at — that, not the band
  table, is the gap between the items and where a large banner's identity
  is committed. It matters only if the banner is the target; it is not.
- Where identity has been bought, by px and band (every arm inside the
  ceiling window for its px; every arm above it lost):

| arm | glyph px | band | identity |
|---|---|---|---|
| `band_s_0923` singles on scenes | 48 | 0.7–0.9 | native 84 / 192 (0.5–0.7: 49) |
| `micro_cf_0922` pieces | 35 | 0.5–0.7 | exact 7 / 32 (0.7–0.9: 1) |
| `p1_cold` / `p1_mix` / `retrain_kana` windows | 34, 18 | 0.5–0.7, 0.3–0.5 | 65, 80 / 128; 29 / 64 ≤ 1 edit |
| singles | 48 | 0.8–0.95 | dead (`windows.py`, `band_c2_kanji`) |
| `garble_replace` cold, warm | 14 | 0.6–0.85 | 0, 5 / 184 official |
| `garble_replace` short50hb | 14 | 0.8–0.95 | 1 / 184 |
| `b0305_reband` warm | 18 | 0.75–0.93 | the banner → small columns |
| `span_reband` warm | 34 | 0.85–0.95 | official 29 → 16 |
| `seed_synth` warm | the redrawn words | 0.85–0.95 | official 29 → 19 |
| `kana_reband` cold | 18 – 52 | 0.75–0.93 | 0 / 72, 0 / 64 |

- The P1 arms re-read for size (36 hiragana donors cold, C2's eight words,
  `en`): in-word identity comes from the small in-word items (`p1_cold`
  65 / 128 with nothing above ≈ 40 px); the lone tier alone composes nothing
  (`p1_lone` 9 / 128) but makes a lone glyph come out once (singles official
  29 → 74–82 / 144) and scales the rendered banner glyph 75 → 87 → 131 px.
  All three still draw a banner under the `reads as` caption; `p1_cold`
  under a bubble caption is unread.

## 4. What the arms on the finished seed closed

All warm from the seed unless noted, read on `sent` 184 against the floor
(official 29 / ≤ 1 edit 92 / dup 100).

| arm | what it changed | official / ≤ 1 edit / dup | where |
|---|---|---|---|
| `polish_seed` μ 0.1, 4 steps / row, 1 362 singles | the seed's own recipe + `scene_line` tiers | 11 / 60 / more doubling | `polish_seed_2026_09_30.md` |
| `polish_seed --color` | coloured scenes only (973 / 1 897) | 10 / 46 | same — "the canvases were not the cause" (warm; open cold) |
| `garble_replace` warm μ 0.1 | the base's garble canvases, string replaced at the garble's px (14), 0.6–0.85 | 5 / 29 / 137 — banner kept, hiragana words → 0 | `garble_replace_2026_09_30.md` |
| `garble_replace` cold | same items from the pack rows | 0 / 0 / 114 — bubbles with long pseudo-JA lines, no banner | same |
| + quoted captions, grid20 / grid50, no humans, μ 0.02, short lines, inverse frequency, 0.8–0.95 | one variable each | 1–3 / ≤ 24; inv_freq ≤ 2 edit 51 → 28 | same, follow-ups |
| `delta_scale` Δ 0.9 / 0.75 (no training) | the seed's Δ shrunk | 10 / 48 / 124; 2 / 5 / 107 — order information restored, identity gone | `delta_scale_2026_10_01.md` |
| `b0305_reband` μ 0.02 | 12–24 px windows at 0.75–0.93 | layout broken (read stopped at 158 / 184) | `hypothesis.md` |
| `span_reband` μ 0.02 | ≈ 34 px windows at 0.85–0.95 × 4 | 16 / 70 / 113 | `proposal_seed_synthesis.md` |
| `seed_synth` swap μ 0.02 | own renders, word redrawn to the region, 0.85–0.95 × 6 | 19 / 71 / 116 | same |

Closed by them: a Δ cap or row scale; garble items at the base's px at any
band; order-paired losses on routed singles; the span lever (rows at
0.85–0.95 refill the region, they do not shorten it); a σ gate at inference
for 0.85–0.95 arms (their whole effect is above 0.8); `cf_sense`-style
teacher-forced count reads; warm polish of converged rows in any shape
(every warm pass of record lost identity; every arm that held it trained
cold from the pack).

Polish's own diagnosis holds for all of them: the rows barely move in
aggregate (warm_cos 0.96–0.996), each rotates a few percent on its own, and
that alone costs the strings. There is no warm move left that is not a
cold question.

## 5. Data properties still unread as causes

From `motivation.md` § 2–3, measured on the data dirs of record; none has a
cold read behind it.

- **Half the scenes are monochrome or line art**: 49.7 % of scene items
  sit on a scene with coloured share < 0.08, 58 % of all items with the
  flat / grid canvases. The warm `--color` polish found no effect;
  `kana_reband` cold leaks monochrome sketch style into the renders.
- **Lettering**: every data dir was drawn with `tategaki=False` (a turned
  ー 〜 … up to 0.2 em off the column axis: 860 / 7 004 vertical windows in
  `retrain_kana`, 606 / 22 931 in `b4`); `scene_window` draws `max_lines=1`,
  so no item has a second column or line while the base breaks JA into
  columns by itself (placed by σ 0.69); small kana in a column are the
  horizontal glyph (2 278 / 7 004, 2 027 / 22 931); 774 / 9 860 and
  929 / 32 141 windows start with ー, a small kana or a closing mark.
- **A grid cell's bubble is not a speech bubble**: a 130–256 px cell filled
  by a bubble around a 16 px glyph. Two renderer opt-ins came out of
  `grid_small`'s builds (user, 10-02): `bubble_fit` (the bubble's inscribed
  rectangle 1.15–1.7 × the ink) and `cell_jitter` (the glyph at its cell's
  centre ± 8 %), both off by default in `src/data/grid.py`.

## 6. What the reseed has to answer first

Running: `grid_small` (`experiments/grid_small`, job `20261002-112155-8e8225`)
— the 81 hiragana rows cold, 135 / row, no lone glyph above 40 px, grids 60 %
of 8 100 items at the band law's bands for their px (`g0507` 0.5–0.7 glyph
25–34 px, `g0305` 0.3–0.5 glyph 12–21 px, `b0507` / `b0305` from
`builder.TABLE`); no 1×1, `bubble_fit` + `cell_jitter` on. Read:
`kana_reband`'s (9 words `en`, 8 singles `swap`) against `retrain_kana`'s
17 / 64 official, 44 contained, and C2's words against `p1_cold` / `p1_mix`.
The singles are the question: does a grid teach identity when its glyphs are
small?

Open after it (`band_size_2026_10_02.md` § Open):

- `p1_cold`-style rows under a bubble caption — does small-only training
  write manga-size text when the caption gives it a bubble? Every
  small-only arm so far was read under `reads as` and drew a banner.
- Small-text identity by σ: the b0305 mirror at switches 0.7 / 0.65 / 0.6 /
  0.5 on the same 16 renders. "No leverage below 0.5" was read on banners.
- A dialogue ruler. `sent` reads a short word as a banner; the 16 b0305
  renders are training captions; sentence-length captions have no floor.
- Kanji at 18 px: every small-only read is hiragana.
- Scene colour and lettering (§ 5) as cold variables, one at a time, only
  after the recipe's bands and sizes are fixed.
- The band's lower edge and peak for small text are still a training read
  (`reports/grad_identity_2026_10_02.md` prices the draws, not the run): the
  same 15–28 px items at two low bands, e.g. the law's (0.3–0.5 / 0.5–0.7)
  against windows on the identity peak (0.3–0.5 / 0.4–0.6; 44 px grid
  0.5–0.7, one step under the law). Also open from that read: whether a
  lone 1×1 should take the box share, and pass 2 on trained rows and on the
  bubble tiers.
