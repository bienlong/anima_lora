"""GUI launch-speed regression guards.

The GUI process must stay light (gui/CLAUDE.md): a single careless import of a
torch/cv2-backed ``library`` module adds ~2.4s warm — and 10-30s after a cold
boot — to every launch (this regressed once via ``library.datasets.subsets``).

Two layers, both in a fresh interpreter (an in-process check would be polluted
by other tests that legitimately import torch):

* ``test_gui_app_import_stays_torch_free`` — the root-cause guard. Fails the
  moment a heavy import sneaks back into the ``gui.app`` chain, regardless of
  how fast the machine is.
* ``test_gui_launch_under_budget`` — end-to-end wall clock: import ``gui.app``,
  build and show ``MainWindow`` offscreen. Budget is generous vs. the ~1.35s
  measured warm launch (Config/Preprocess eager, everything else behind
  ``LazyTabHolder``) so a loaded machine doesn't flake it, while a
  torch-sized regression — or eager-building the lazy tabs again — still
  trips.

  Imports are NOT the usual suspect when this trips: they are ~0.18s of the
  total, and construction is the rest. Split it before profiling imports::

      t0 → import gui.app → QApplication() → MainWindow() → show()

  Known construction costs, in case a future regression needs a baseline
  (measured 2026-08-17, warm, offscreen):

  * ``PreprocessingTab._refresh_status`` ~0.39s — stats the whole dataset
    (``_filtered_files`` + ``count_preprocess_caches`` + ``_count_resized``,
    ~26k ``stat`` calls). Scales with dataset size, so a big corpus makes this
    the dominant term.
  * ``tensorboard._refresh_runs`` ~0.26s — builds one row widget per run under
    ``output/logs`` (661 of them here) for a panel that starts hidden. Scales
    with run count.
  * ~0.45s of genuine Qt widget-tree construction (``addWidget``).

  Both scans are eager and could be deferred, but they feed UI the user sees
  immediately; neither has been moved.
