"""Crash-resume state for the turbo distillation loop.

``save_student`` ships only the student LoRA — the critic, discriminator, and
all three optimizer/scheduler pairs are training scaffolding that only ever
lived in RAM. A mid-run death loses all of it: restarting from a step-tagged
checkpoint would re-warm a *cold* critic against an *already trained* student
and reset the LR cosine to its peak — the exact regime the critic runaway lives
in. This module checkpoints the rest of the loop so a restart continues the run
instead of re-opening it.

The bundle is a single rolling ``{output_name}_resume.pt`` next to the
step-tagged students, overwritten each ``save_every`` and written atomically
(tmp + ``os.replace``, so a crash mid-write leaves the previous bundle intact).
Only the latest is kept — it's ~10x a student checkpoint's size (two AdamW
moments in fp32 over both LoRA stacks), and the step-tagged students already
preserve the trajectory.

Not restored: the dataloader's position within its epoch (perturbs sample
order, not the optimizer/critic/schedule state that actually carries the run).
