"""Target white-balance for the colorize task.

The colorize target corpus is corpus-wide warm/desaturated; with high
caption dropout the adapter reproduces that sepia tone on every cond. Fix:
neutralize each target's white-point at prep time and encode into a
colorize-specific target-latent cache.

Pure numpy on uint8 RGB ``(H, W, 3)`` arrays; the prep stage wires these into
``library.preprocess.cache_latents``'s ``image_transform`` hook.
